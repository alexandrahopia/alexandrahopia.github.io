  <h2>About me:</h2>
  
  <p>​​Hey!
    I'm Alexandra, a 22-year-old woman from Helsinki.
    <br> I have been working in customer service since 2017. This time includes working in the store, as a lobby service person, as a customer service person and now most recently as a rental assistant.
    At the moment I am studying my first year of Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am a really self-initiated, hardworking and conscientious person. I like to see the results of my own work and to help and serve customers. I'm always interested in taking on new challenges and learning new things.
    <br>
